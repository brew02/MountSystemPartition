# MountSystemPartition

This project demonstrates a method of mounting the system (hidden EFI partition) on Windows only using the Windows API.

## Motivation

I couldn't find any good examples of how to programmatically mount the system partition on Windows, so I decided to
release an example of how to do it in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situtation in the future.
